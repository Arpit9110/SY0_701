### Internal Audits and Assessments

Internal Audits
It the process of systematic evaluations conducted by an organization's own audit team. The team  assess the effectiveness of internal controls, compliance with regulations, and the integrity of information systems and processes. 
Their main focus areas may include:
 - Data protection 
 - Network security 
 - Access controls 
 - Incident response procedures  

Examples of internal audit focus areas : Password policies , User access controls.

Process of the internal audit are:
- Reviewing policies and procedures 
- Examining access rights 
- Testing effectiveness of controls 
- Findings documented for recommendations and improvements

Key Concept sin Internal Audits 

Compliance Requirements

It involves with ensuring adherence to established standards, regulations, and laws. Compliance is essential for protecting sensitive data and avoiding legal penalties, because of this internal audits are required for compliance with specific laws or regulations.

Audit Committee

It is a group, often comprising members of a company's board of directors, overseeing audit and compliance activities. They Addresses issues raised by auditors.
Their responsibilities include involves :
- Reviewing financial reporting 
- Internal controls 
- Internal and external audits 
- Legal and regulatory compliance

Internal Assessments
It is conducted to identify and evaluate potential risks and vulnerabilities in an organization's information systems. It is Commonly performed before implementing new systems or making significant changes to existing ones. 
It also have a concept of Self-assessments, which involves internal evaluations assessing compliance with specific standards or regulations.

Vulnerability assessments, threat modelling exercises, and risk assessments are part of internal assessments also the assisted internal assessments may involve dedicated assessment groups.

Internal Assessment Process includes:

- Threat Modelling Exercise : It involves identifying potential threats to applications (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, DoS attacks).

- Vulnerability Assessment: It involves usages of automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques to identify known vulnerabilities and code weaknesses. 

- Risk Assessment 
  It Evaluates the potential impact of the following:
	- Identified threats and vulnerabilities with it's considering likelihood 
	- Potential damage 
	- Cost of security measure
Mitigation Strategies 
These are the recommendations to address risks and vulnerabilities 
- Code fixes 
- Additional security controls 
- Architectural changes


### Performing an Internal Assessment

Internal Assessment
It is a proactive evaluation of an organization's security posture. It helps to identify and address potential risks and vulnerabilities in information systems.

Using a Sample Checklist
It refers to the using of specific checklists and procedures for an internal assessment may vary based on the following:
- Organization's governance 
- Risk 
- Compliance practices
A sample checklist from the Minnesota Counties Intergovernmental Trust (MCIT) is used as an example  

MCIT Cybersecurity Self-Assessment 

MCIT's Cybersecurity Self-Assessment checklist is designed to help organizations minimize data and cybersecurity-related exposures. It assists in identifying areas where data security may need strengthening. The checklist comprises yes-or-no questions with sections for comments and action items. Action items are assigned to specific individuals or groups responsible for implementing corrective actions.


Collaborative Approach: In this approach to maximize the checklist's effectiveness involve a diverse group of participants from across the organization like Administration team, Information technology staff and Cybersecurity professional.

Overview of checklist
- The checklist is broad and aims to provide a quick overview of the organization's current risk posture
- Organizations may use different checklists or variations with distinct questions 
- The general format and purpose of self-assessments are consistent across most organizations.

### External Audits and Assessments

External Audits and Assessments

It is an essential tools for maintaining a robust security posture and ensuring regulatory compliance. It is conducted by independent third parties to provide an unbiased perspective on an organization's security. 

External Audits

It is Systematic evaluations conducted by independent entities. In this they Assess information systems, applications, and security controls They mainly focuses on various areas such as :
- Data protection 
- Network security 
- Access controls
- Incident response procedures 
Objective is to identify gaps in security policies and controls for compliance with regulatory standards such as: 
- GDPR 
- HIPAA 
- PCIDSS


External Assessments

It includes detailed analysis by independent entities to identify vulnerabilities and risks in an organization's security systems. It utilize automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques. The external assessments can take various forms such as:
- Risk assessments 
- Vulnerability assessments
- Threat assessments

Regulatory compliance 

- It's goal is to ensure organizations comply with relevant laws, policies, and regulations.
- Organizations adopt consolidated and harmonized sets of compliance controls to achieve regulatory compliance, e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
- Compliance includes adherence to industry-specific rules (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS) and more generalized regulations like GDPR.

Examinations
It is the detailed inspections of an organization's security infrastructure conducted externally. It is very crucial for maintaining a strong security posture and regulatory compliance. It cover various areas such as: 
- Network security 
- Data protection 
- Access controls 
It also may include testing of the following 
- Key personnel 
- Certifications 
- Standardized assessments 

Independent Third-Party Audits

This provide an unbiased perspective on an organization's security posture. It validate security measures and build trust with Customers , Stakeholder and Regulatory bodies. Sometimes it is also required by regulations like GDPR and PCI DSS for organizations to undergo regular independent third-party audits.



### Performing an external Assessment


External Assessment 
It is a part of maintaining a robust security posture and ensuring compliance It may  May vary based on the following 
● Organization's governance 
● Risk 
● Compliance practices 

Sample checklist are used for a HIPAA external assessment from the government of San Bernardino County, California as a demonstration. It's purpose is to validate compliance with specific regulations and minimize cybersecurity risks.

Preparing for a HIPAA External Assessment 
-  Examiners provide a checklist of questions that organizations must answer 
- Questions are answered as either "yes" or "no" 
- Evidence files, such as documents or links, must be provided to demonstrate compliance 
- 
Sample Checklist 
- Questions cover various aspects like general information, policies, procedures, and employee training.
- Organizations must provide evidence files as proof of compliance. 
- External assessments aim to provide a quick overview of the organization's current risk posture.
