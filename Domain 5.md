# Malware

### Viruses

 Computer virus :  These are the malicious programs that made of malicious code that runs on a machine without the user's knowledge and this allow the code to infect the computer whenever it has been run.

 10 Different types of Viruses
 
 - Boot sector : This is the virus that is stored in the first sector of a hard drive and is then loaded into the memory whenever the computer boots up.
 
 - Macro : This is a form of code that allows a virus to be embedded inside another document so that when the document is opened by the user, the virus is executed.
 
 - Program : This type of virus tries to find executable or a application file to infect with their malicious code.
 
 - Multipartite : This a combination of boot sector type virus and a program virus. This type of virus place itself in the boot sector and is loaded every time the computer is boots. It can install a program where it can be run every time the system boots up.
  
 - Encrypted : It is designed to hide itself from being detected by encrypting it's malicious code or payloads to avoid detection by any antivirus software. 
 
 - Polymorphic : This is a type of an encrypted virus, but instead of just encryption of the code it also changes the virus code each time when it is executed by altering the decryption module in order for it evade detection. 
 
 - Metamorphic : This type of virus is able to re-write themself entirely before it infects a given file. 
 
 - Stealth : This is a technique that is used to prevent the virus from being detected by the anti-virus software.
 
 - Armored : This type of virus have a layer of protection to confuse a program or a person who's trying to analyse it.
 
 - Hoax : It is a from of technical social engineering that attempts to scare our end user into taking some kind of undesirable action on their system.
### Worms
These are the piece of malicious software, much like a virus, but it can replicate itself without any user interaction. These software are able to self replicate and spread throughout your network without user's consent or their action. 
Worms are dangerous for 2 reasons:
- They infect your workstation and other computing assets 
- These causes disruption to your normal network traffic as they are constantly trying to replicate and spread across the network.
The worms are best known for their ability of spreading far and wide over the internet in a relative short amount of time.

### Trojans 
 
 These are the piece of malicious software that is disguised as a piece of harmless or desirable software. It disguise themself in form of useful piece of software.

Remote Access Trojan (RAT) : These ae widely used by modern attacker because it provides the attacker with remote control of victim machine.

Trojan are commonly used today by attacker to exploit a vulnerability in your system and then conduct data exfiltration to steal your sensitive documents, creating backdoors to maintain persistence on your system and other malicious activities.

### Ransomware 

Ransome are the type of malicious software that is designed to block access to a computer system or it's data by encrypting it until a ransom is paid to the attacker. 

To protect against Ransome one can take safety precaution like: 
Always conduct regular backups.
Install software update regularly.
Provide security awareness training to your users.
 Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

What should you do if you find yourself or your organization as the victim of a ransomware attack :
- Never Pay the ransom  : paying the ransom doesn't actually guarantee that you will  ever get your data back. 
- If you suspect ransomware has infect your machine you should disconnect it from the network. 
- Notify the authorities.
- Restore your data and system form known good backups.
### Zombies and Botnets

Botnet: network of compromised computer or device that is part of s botnet.

Zombie : It is a name of a compromised computer or devices that is part of a botnet.  Used to perform task using remote commands form the attacker without the user's knowledge.

Command and Control Node : Computer responsible for managing and coordinating the activities of other nodes or devices within a network.

Botnets are used :
- As pivot points
- disguise the real attacker
- to host illegal activities
- To spam others by sending out phishing campaigns and other malware
The most common use for botnets is to conduct a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack
