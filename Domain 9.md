# Third-party Vendor Risks

### Supply Chain Risks

Hardware Manufacturers: Products like routers and switches are composed of many components from various suppliers. Tampering component or untrustworthy vendors can introduce vulnerabilities. Rigorous supply chain assessments is needed to trace origins and component integrity. Trusted foundry programs ensure secure manufacturing. 

Secondary/Aftermarket Sources: It have the risk of acquiring counterfeit or tampered devices.  These devices may contain malware or vulnerabilities. These devices are budget-friendly but high-risk option. 

Software Developers/Providers: Software developers and software providers are integral cogs in the supply chain however, software can introduce vulnerabilities. Always check for proper licensing, authenticity, known vulnerabilities, and malware. Open-source software allows source code review and proprietary software cab be scanned for vulnerability. 

Service Providers/MSPs

Managed Service Providers: Organizations that provide a range of technology services and support to businesses and other clients 

Security challenges with Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers: There are Data confidentiality and integrity concerns. Assess provider's cybersecurity protocols and support for security incidents. Vendor selection should consider due diligence, historical performance, and commitment to security.

Considerations to take while having service provider's are:

- Evaluate data security measures 
- Ensure confidentiality and integrity 
- Assess cybersecurity protocols 
- Response to a security breach

### Supply Chain Attacks

Supply Chain Attacks: An attack that targets a weaker link in the supply chain to gain access to a primary target. The attacker exploit vulnerabilities in suppliers or service providers to access more secure systems. 

CHIPS Act of 2022: U.S. federal statute providing funding to boost semiconductor research and manufacturing in the U.S. It aims to reduce reliance on foreign-made semiconductors, strengthen the domestic supply chain, and enhance security. 

Semiconductors: These are essential components in a wide range of products, from smartphones and cars to medical devices and defence systems.

Safeguarding Against Supply Chain Attacks

- Vendor Due Diligence: By doing rigorous evaluation of vendor cybersecurity and supply chain practices.

- Regular Monitoring & Audits: Continuous monitoring and periodic audits of supply chains to detect suspicious activities.

- Education and Collaboration: Sharing threat information and best practices within the industry. Collaborating with organizations and industry groups for joint defences.

- Incorporating Contractual Safeguards: Embedding cybersecurity clauses in contracts with suppliers or service providers. It Ensures adherence to security standards with legal repercussions for non-compliance.

### Vendor Assessment 

Vendor assessment: It is the process to evaluate the security, reliability, and performance of external entities. It is crucial due to interconnectivity and potential impact on multiple businesses. 

Entities in vendor Assessment

- Vendor: These provide goods or services to organizations.

- Suppliers: They are involved in production and delivery of products or parts.

- Managed Service Providers (MPS): They manage IT services on behalf of organizations.


Penetration Testing of Suppliers
Penetration is a simulated cyberattacks to identity vulnerabilities in supplier system. Validating the supplier's cybersecurity practices and potential risk to your organization.
