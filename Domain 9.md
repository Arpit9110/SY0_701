# Third-party Vendor Risks

### Supply Chain Risks

Hardware Manufacturers: Products like routers and switches are composed of many components from various suppliers. Tampering component or untrustworthy vendors can introduce vulnerabilities. Rigorous supply chain assessments is needed to trace origins and component integrity. Trusted foundry programs ensure secure manufacturing. 

Secondary/Aftermarket Sources: It have the risk of acquiring counterfeit or tampered devices.  These devices may contain malware or vulnerabilities. These devices are budget-friendly but high-risk option. 

Software Developers/Providers: Software developers and software providers are integral cogs in the supply chain however, software can introduce vulnerabilities. Always check for proper licensing, authenticity, known vulnerabilities, and malware. Open-source software allows source code review and proprietary software cab be scanned for vulnerability. 

Service Providers/MSPs

Managed Service Providers: Organizations that provide a range of technology services and support to businesses and other clients 

Security challenges with Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers: There are Data confidentiality and integrity concerns. Assess provider's cybersecurity protocols and support for security incidents. Vendor selection should consider due diligence, historical performance, and commitment to security.

Considerations to take while having service provider's are:

- Evaluate data security measures 
- Ensure confidentiality and integrity 
- Assess cybersecurity protocols 
- Response to a security breach

### Supply Chain Attacks

Supply Chain Attacks: An attack that targets a weaker link in the supply chain to gain access to a primary target. The attacker exploit vulnerabilities in suppliers or service providers to access more secure systems. 

CHIPS Act of 2022: U.S. federal statute providing funding to boost semiconductor research and manufacturing in the U.S. It aims to reduce reliance on foreign-made semiconductors, strengthen the domestic supply chain, and enhance security. 

Semiconductors: These are essential components in a wide range of products, from smartphones and cars to medical devices and defence systems.

Safeguarding Against Supply Chain Attacks
