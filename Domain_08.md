## Risk Management
     
### Risk Assessment Frequency

 Risk Assessment Frequency: It is basically the regularity with which risk assessments are conducted within an organization. 
 
 Four main types of risk assessment frequencies are: 
  - Ad-Hoc Risk Assessments: In this frequency the assessment is conducted as needed, often in response to specific events or situations. This address the potential new risk or changes in existing risk.
  
  - Recurring Risk Assessments: In this frequency the assessment is conducted at regular interval for e.g: annually, quartely, monthly. In sone condition this frequency becomes the part of standard oprating procedure for continual risk identification and management.
  
  - One-Time Risk Assessments: In this frequency the assessment is conducted for specific projects or initiatives. The assessment is not repeated, and is associated with a particular purpose.
  
  - Continuous Risk Assessments: In this frequency the assessment is always ongoing and monitoring and evaluation of risk. This is enabled by technology, involving real-time data collection and analysis. This frequency is used for proactive threats and vulnerability monitoring which facilitates quick responses.
  
  
  
### Risk Identification 
  Risk Identification: This is first crucial step in the risk management. It involves recognizing potential risk that could impact an organization. Risk can vary from financial and operational to strategic and reputational. One should always document and analyse risk based on impact and likelihood. The organization should consider a wide range of risk, including operational, financial, strategic and reputational risk. Different Techniques of identifying the risk are: 
    - Brainstorming
    - checklists
    - Interviews
    - Scenario Analysis
    
  Business Impact Analysis (BIA): This refers to the evaluation of the effects of disruptions on business functions. It identifies and prioritizes critical functions, and assesses impact of risks on those functions. It also determine the required recovery time for functions.
  
  Key metrics in BIA are:
   
   - RTO (Recovery Time Objective): This is basically the maximum time before which the business will have sever impact on it's business. It can also be said that it is the target time for restoring a business process.
     
   - RPO (Recovery Point Objective): It is maximum amount of data that can be lost which is measured in Time for example a company can afford to loose one day worth of data during an emergency. It is point in time before which all the data should be recovered.
   
   - MTTR (Mean Time to Repair): It is the average time to repair a failed components or system. This is the indicator of repair speed and amount of downtime.
   
   - MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure): It is the average time between two consecutive system or component failure. It is the measure of reliability. 
   
   
### Risk Register
 Risk Management: It is a crucial for project and business, it involves the identification and assessment of uncertainties that may impact the project objectives.
 
 Risk Register: This register records identified risk, descriptions, impacts, likelihood, and mitigation actions. It is a key tool in risk management. It may resemble a heat map of the risk matrix. It facilitates communication and risk tracking. It is the Key component of project and business operations.
 
 Components of Risk Register
  
  - Risk Description: It identifies and describes the risk. It is also a very clean and concise description of it. 
  
  - Risk Impact: It is the potential consequence of risk occurrence. It is rated on a scale of low, medium and High.
  
  - Risk likelihood: It is basically the probability of risk occurrence. It is rated on a scale mostly numerical or descriptive.
  
  - Risk Outcome: It is the result of the risk if it occurs. It is related to th eimpact and likelihood of risk.
  
  - Risk Level or threshold: It determined by combining the impact and likelihood. It help in prioritizes risk for ex. high imapact and high likelyhood at very to low impact and low likelyhood at very bottom.
  
  - Cost: It analyse the financial impact on the project. It include potential expense or the cost of risk mitigation.
  
  
### Risk Tolerance and Risk Appetite
  
  Risk tolerance and Risk Acceptance: It is basically the maximum amount if risk an organization is willing to accept. It can also be defines as an organization or a individual's willingness to deal with uncertainty in pursuit of their goals. It is acceptance of risk without countermeasure. 
   
  Risk Appetite: It is the willingness to persue or retain risk. It's type are Expansionary, Conservative or Neutral.
  
 Key Risk Indicators (KRIs): It is basically a predictive metrics signaling increasing risk exposure. It provides a early warning of potential risks. It is used to monitor risk changes and take proactive steps.
 
 Risk Owner: It is the one that is responsible for the management of the risk. It Monitors, implements mitigation actions, and updates Risk Register. He/She is accountable for risk management.
 
 
### Qualitative Risk Analysis

Qualitative Risk Analysis: It is the primary method in risk management. It assess risk based on potential impact and likelihood. It categorizes risk as low, medium, high. The analysis is very subjective and and relies on expertise and experience. It helps in avoiding quantitative complexity.
 
Key Components

Likelihood/Probability: It is basically the chance risk occurrence. It is qualitatively expressed as low, medium and high. It is based on past experience, statistical analysis, or expert judgment.

Impact: It is the potential consequences if risk occurs. It is qualitatively rated as low medium and high. It asses damage to project or business objectives.
  
Impact levels is represented as:
 - Low Impact: It represent minor damage, essential functions are operational.
     
 - Medium Impact: It represent significant damage, possibly loss to assets.
     
 - High Impact: It represent to major damage, possibly essential functions impaired.
     
### Quantitative Risk Analysis

Quantitative Risk Analysis: It provides objective and numerical evaluation of risks. It is used for financial, safety, and scheduling decisions.
 
Key component are: 
 
- Exposure Factor (EF): It indicates asset loss severity. It tells the proportion of asset that will be lost in an event (0% to 100%).
  
- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE):  It calculate the monetary value expected to be lost in a single event. It is calculated as Asset Value x Exposure Factor (EF).
  
- Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO): It is the estimated frequency of threat occurrence within a year. It provides a yearly probability
  
- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE): It is expected annual loss from a risk. it is calculated as SLE x ARO. 
  

### Risk Management Strategies
There are four major type of risk management Strategies:
 
Risk Transfer : In this method the threat owner shifts the risk to another party. It the shifting is done 2 common ways namely:
 - Insurance
 - Contract Indemnity clause: A contractual agreement is an agreement where one party agrees to cover the otherâ€™s harm, liability, or loss stemming from the contract.
 This method dose not remove the risk but rather than that it shifts the responsibility for handling the risk's financial consequences. 

Risk Acceptance : In this method the threat owner chose to acknowledge and deal with risk if it occurs. It is used when the cost of managing the risk out weighs the potential loss or risk in unlikely to have a significant impact. No action to mitigate the risk are taken.
The method to do this are : 
- Exemption
- Exception
In both Exemption and Exception, the organization assumes risk either by operating without the safeguards or mitigations offered by a rule (exemption), or by operating in a way that lets them evade the risk (exception).


Risk Avoidance : In this method the risk owner change plans or strategies to eliminate a specific risk. The risk owner choses when the risk is too great to accept or transfer.

Risk Mitigation :  In this method the risk owner take steps to reduce likelihood or impact of risk. The common strategy involving various actions to mitigate it when occurred.

### Risk Monitoring and Reporting

Risk Monitoring
Risk Monitoring is the process of :
- Tracking identified risks 
- Monitoring residual risks 
- Identifying new risks 
- Evaluating risk response plans
It involves ongoing tracking of risks and their response actions. It helps in determining Residual 

Risk and Control Risk:

Residual Risk : The likelihood and impact of the risk after mitigation, transference, or acceptance measures have been taken on the initial risk.

Control Risk : Assessment of how a security measure has lost effectiveness over time.

Risk Reporting: It is the communication of information about risk management activities to stakeholders. It includes the results of risk identification, assessment, response, and monitoring. It is often presented in the form of a risk report.


Risk Monitoring and Reporting are essential for :

- Informed decision making: Offering insights for informed decisions on resource allocation, project timelines, and strategic planning

- Risk Mitigation: It about recognizing when a risk is escalating so that it can be mitigated before becoming an issue 

- Stakeholder communication: It assist in setting expectations and showing effective risk management.

- Regulatory compliance: It demonstrate compliance with these regulations
