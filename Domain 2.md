- 1.2-Summarizefundamental security concepts  
- 2.1-Compare and contrast Common Threat Actors and Motivations 
- 2.2-Explain common Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces

### Threat Actor 

It is an Individual or entity responsible for incidents that impact data security. 
### Threat Actor Motivations 
 There is a difference between the intent of the attack and the motivation that fuels that attack 
#### Threat Actor Intent

#### Difference Motivations behind threat actors
##### Data Exfiltration 
 <font color="#ffff00">It refers to unauthorized transfer of data from a computer</font>. Like stealing You private information like IP address, Intellectual Property, Personally Identifiable Information(PII), Trade secret,  with the purpose of Selling it on the dark web, Using it for identity theft, Leveraging it for a competitive advantage.
##### Financial Gain 
  - It is one of the most common motivation for cybercriminal. They achieve it through various means, such as  <font color="#ffff00">ransomware  attack,  trojan horse to get login info to steal financial info.</font>
##### Blackmail
 Attacker obtains sensitive or compromising information in order to threatens to release that information to the public Unless certain demands are met (Usually it involves financial gain).

##### Philosophical or political Beliefs 
 Attack that are conducted due to the philosophical or political beliefs of the attackers is known as hacktivism.  Common motivation for a specific type of threat actor known as a hacktivist.

##### Ethical Reasons
 Ethical hackers are authorised hacker motivated to improve security.

##### Revenge
  the motivation for a actor to harm an entity that they believed has wronged them in some way.

##### Disruption or Chaos 
  Creating and spreading malware to launching sophisticated cyberattacks against the critical infrastructure in a populated city
  
##### Espionage

### Threat Actor Attributes

1. There are many threat actors but the most basic is Internal and eternal threat actor.

- Internal Threat actor: Individual or groups of individual that are inside the organization and pose threat to it's security.
-  External threat actor: The group of individual or an individual that is outside of an organization  who attempt to breach the cybersecurity defence of that organization.

2. Resource and funding available to the these specific threat actor. This refers to the resources at disposal of the threat actor.
3. Level of sophistication and capability of the specific threat actor. It refers to the level of complexity of the tools, Technical skill, and the ability to evade countermeasure of the threat actor. 
    In cyber security we classify the lowest skill threat actor as the Script Kiddies.
    
    Script Kiddies:  These are the individual with the limited technical knowledge. These threat actor use use pre-made software and script to exploit computers system and network.
    
   Nation State Actors, Advance Persistent threat  (A.P.T) and others have high level of complexity and capabilities they  posses advance technical skills.
### Unskilled Attacker
These ate the individual That do not have enough knowledge and skill to develop their own Attacks or exploit. These individual individual use exploit and attacks that are developed by others to perform cyber attack.

These attacker can do DDOS attack or can just put the IP of the victim's system and run the pre-made exploit.

### Hacktivists
