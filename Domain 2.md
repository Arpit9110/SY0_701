- 1.2-Summarizefundamental security concepts  
- 2.1-Compare and contrast Common Threat Actors and Motivations 
- 2.2-Explain common Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces

### Threat Actor 

It is an Individual or entity responsible for incidents that impact data security. 
### Threat Actor Motivations 
 There is a difference between the intent of the attack and the motivation that fuels that attack 
#### Threat Actor Intent
  <font color="#ffff00">Specific objective or goal</font> that a threat actor is aiming to achieve through their attack.
#### Threat Actors Motivation
<font color="#ffff00">Underlying reason or driving force</font> that pushes a threat actor to carry out their attack.

#### Difference Motivations behind threat actors
##### Data Exfiltration 
 <font color="#ffff00">It refers to unauthorized transfer of data from a computer</font>. Like stealing You private information like IP address, Intellectual Property, Personally Identifiable Information(PII), Trade secret,  with the purpose of Selling it on the dark web, Using it for identity theft, Leveraging it for a competitive advantage.
##### Financial Gain 
  - It is one of the most common motivation for cybercriminal. They achieve it through various means, such as  <font color="#ffff00">ransomware  attack,  trojan horse to get login info to steal financial info.</font>
##### Blackmail
 Attacker obtains sensitive or compromising information in order to threatens to release that information to the public Unless certain demands are met (Usually it involves financial gain).
##### Service Disruption 
  Some attacks aims to disrupt the services to<font color="#ffff00"> create chaos , political statement or for ransom to an organization.</font>

##### Philosophical or political Beliefs 
 Attack that are conducted due to the philosophical or political beliefs of the attackers is known as hacktivism.  Common motivation for a specific type of threat actor known as a hacktivist.

##### Ethical Reasons
 Ethical hackers are authorised hacker motivated to improve security.

##### Revenge
  the motivation for a actor to harm an entity that they believed has wronged them in some way.

##### Disruption or Chaos 
  Creating and spreading malware to launching sophisticated cyberattacks against the critical infrastructure in a populated city
  
##### Espionage 
 Spying on a individuals, organizations, or nations to gather sensitive or classified information

##### War 
  Cyberwarfare can be used to disrupt a country's infrastructure, compromise its national security, and to cause economic damage.

### Threat Actor Attributes

1. There are many threat actors but the most basic is Internal and eternal threat actor.

- Internal Threat actor: Individual or groups of individual that are inside the organization and pose threat to it's security.
-  External threat actor: The group of individual or an individual that is outside of an organization  who attempt to breach the cybersecurity defence of that organization.

2. Resource and funding available to the these specific threat actor. This refers to the resources at disposal of the threat actor.
3. Level of sophistication and capability of the specific threat actor. It refers to the level of complexity of the tools, Technical skill, and the ability to evade countermeasure of the threat actor. 
    In cyber security we classify the lowest skill threat actor as the Script Kiddies.
    
    Script Kiddies:  These are the individual with the limited technical knowledge. These threat actor use use pre-made software and script to exploit computers system and network.
    
   Nation State Actors, Advance Persistent threat  (A.P.T) and others have high level of complexity and capabilities they  posses advance technical skills.
### Unskilled Attacker
These ate the individual That do not have enough knowledge and skill to develop their own Attacks or exploit. These individual individual use exploit and attacks that are developed by others to perform cyber attack.

These attacker can do DDOS attack or can just put the IP of the victim's system and run the pre-made exploit.

### Hacktivists 
   - Hacktivist :   
            Individual or group of individual that use their technical skill to promote a cause or dive a social change instead personal gain.       
            These people are motivate by an ideological belief rather than the financial gains.
   
   - Hacktivism : 
                    Activities in which  Hacking and other cyber technique are used to promote or advance a political of social cause
   To achieve their goal the hacktivist use various technique such as:
   - Website Defacement: This method the threat actor gain  unauthorised access to the website and alter it's content to display a message or a statement supporting their agenda.  Like virtual graffiti.
   - DDOS : DDOS stands for Distributed Denial of service. It a method by which the attacker use fake payload to overwhelm the serve to stop it's normal functioning, and make website or the running service on the server, unavailable  to the public. 
   - Doxing: In this the attacker publicly release the private information of an individual or an organization.
   - Leaking Sensitive Information: Revealing secret information like trade secret, secret Technology to the public at large.
   Most well Known Hacking Group is "ANONYMOUS".

### Organised Crime

- Organised cybercrime groups are group ae group of  syndicates that have banded together to conduct criminal activities in the digital world. These are very sophisticated and well structured organization who have a lot of resources.

- In Terms of their capabilities, organized crime groups posses a very high level of technical capability and they often employ advance hacking technique and tools. They can do things like custom Malware, Ransomware, Sophisticated Phishing Campaigns. 

- These group engage in many criminal activities like Data breach, Identity Theft, Online Fraud, Ransomware Attacks.

- Organized cybercrime group are typically driven by Monetary gain. They can include in activities like being hired by other entities including government to conduct cyber attacks. They do not only care about political or social effect of their attack.
### Nation-state Actor

- These individuals or group of people are sponsored by a government to conduct cyber operation against other nations, organizations or individuals.

- These threat actor attempts a false Flag attack to divert the attention of the authorities to create a diversion or to falsely accuse some other country.

- (False Flag Attack:- Attack that is orchestrated in such a way that it appears to originate  from a different source or group that the actual perpetrator with intention to mislead the investigation.)

- These threat actor posses advance technical skills and extensive resources, they are expert in conducting complex and coordinated cyber operation with techniques like Creating custom malware, Using Zero day attack, Becoming an Advanced Persistent Threat.

- Nation-state actors are motivated to achieve their long-term strategic goals, and they are not seeking financial gain.
### Advance Persistent Threat (APT)

- These attack are long-term persistence , targeted cyberattack in which an intruder gain unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period while trying to steal data or monitor network activities rather than cause immediate damage. 

### Insider Threats

- Cybersecurity Threat That originate from inside the organization. These peoples have varying levels of capabilities. 

-  Insider threat can take various forms like Data Theft , Sabotage, misuse of access privilege.

- Each insider threat is divided by  different motivation like :  Financial gain from selling organization sensitive data , revenge against organization, to create awareness in organization.

- To mitigate the risk one can follow following policy like zero trust architecture, Employ robust access control, regular audits, Provide effective employee security awareness program.
