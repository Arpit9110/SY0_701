# Physical Security 

### Fencing and Bollards

  - Fence: It is a structure that encloses an area using interconnected panels or posts, In terms of physical security fences serve several purposes such as Providing a visual deterrent by defining a boundary that should not be violated by unauthorized personnel, Establish a physical barrier against unauthorized entry, Effectively delay intruders which helps provide our security personnel a longer window of time to react. Fencing is considered to be more adaptable and well-suited for safeguarding large perimeters around the entire building.
  - Bollards: It is a robust, short vertical posts, typically made of steel or concrete, that are designed to manage or redirect vehicular traffic. Bollards are really designed to counter vehicular threats in a specific area instead.

Fencing and bollards stand out as some of the most primitive tools that are employed to safeguard assets and people
### Attacking with Brute Force

   Brute Force In Cyber space
    In this attack  access to a system is gained by simply trying all of the possibilities until you break through. 

   Brute force In Physical Security
   - Forcible Entry: Act of gaining  unauthorized access to a space by breaking or bypassing physical barriers like doors windows fences etc. This can be prevented by using High strength doors with deadbolt lock, metal frames, or solid core. 
   
   - Tampering with security Devices: It involves manipulating security devices to create new vulnerability that can be exploited. To prevent this one should have redundancy in physical security measure.

   - Confronting Security Personal: It involves direct confrontation or attack on the organization's security personal. It can be prevented by providing rigorous conflict resolution and self defence training.
   
   - Ramming barrier with vehicle: Using a car truck or other motorised vehicle  to ram into the organization gates or vicinity. By installing bollards or reinforced barriers to prevent vehicles from driving into the facility.
### Surveillance System

Organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activities in a given area 

Surveillance is often comprised of four main categories 

- Video Surveillance: It includes these following things:
    - Remote access
    - Can include the following:
        - Motion Detection
        - Night vision 
        - Facial Recognition 
        - Real - Time Visual Feedback
        A wired version  of this is camera physically connected back to the central monitoring station. Wireless version of this relies on Wi-Fi to transmit the data back to the central monitoring system.  Morden cameras comes wit **Pan-Tilt-zoom** system which helps to position camera in a better angle view over all possible angle. Camera should always be configures to record what they observe.
        Best Place to setup camera are:
	     - Data Center 
	     - Telecommunication closet
          - Entrance and exit areas

- Security Guard
     Flexible and adaptable form of surveillance that organization use. It helps to reassure your staff or your customers that they are safe.

- Lighting 
     Proper lighting is crucial for conducting effective surveillance using both video or security guard. If a well lit area created  is created it can deter criminal, reduce shadows, reduce hiding spots ad enhance the quality of your video recordings.

- Sensors
    These are the devices that detect and respond to external stimuli or changes in the environment. There are four major category of sensor.
     
    - Infrared Sensors:  Detect changes in infrared radiation that is often emitted by  warm bodies like humans or animals 
    
	- Pressure Sensors: Activated whenever a specified minimum amount of weight is detected on the sensor that is embedded into the floor or a mat 
    
	- Microwave Sensors: Detect movement in an area by emitting microwave pulses and measuring their reflection off moving objects 
    
	- Ultrasonic Sensors: This sensor Measures the reflection of ultrasonic waves off moving objects.
### Bypassing Surveillance Systems 

   Some of the different methods used by attacks to bypass the organization's  surveillance systems are: 
   - Visual  Obstruction : In this camera's line of sight is blocked by using various methods like : 
     - Spraying paint or foam onto the camera lens.
     - Placing a sticker or tape over the lens. 
    - Positioning objects like balloons or umbrellas in front of the cameras to block it's view.
- Blinding Sensor and Cameras : This method involves overwhelming the sensor or cameras with sudden burst of light to render it ineffective for limited period of time.

- Interfering with Acoustics : In this method the attacker jams the acoustic system or by playing loud music making microphone ineffective.   Acoustic system are designed to listen to the environment to detect if someone is in the area or to eavesdrop on their conversations. 

- Interfering with Electromagnetic : EMI Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). This Attack involves jamming the monitoring system's signals with the help of electromagnetic Waves.

- Attacking the Physical Environment : Exploit the environment around the surveillance equipment to compromise their functionality.

- Physical tampering like cutting wires or physically disabling devices is an effective strategy to bypass surveillance systems.  

Modern Surveillance system are equipped with countermeasure to help protect surveillance system from the countermeasure.


### Access Control Vestibules
Access control Vestibules: It as a system of  two doors which are electronically controlled to ensure that only one door can be open at a given time. These  helps in preventing the incident like tailgating and piggybacking. 

  - Piggybacking: In this incident 2 people , one of them authorized intentionally lets the  another unauthorized individual to enter the secure premises with them.
  
  - Tailgating: In this unauthorised individual closely follow the authorised individual and get into the secure space without the knowledge and consent of the authorized individual.
The difference between both the incident is of consent of the authorised personal in the case of tailgating the unauthorized personal do not have the consent of the authorised personal and vice a versa in the piggybacking case.

Access control vestibules are usually integrated with electronic badges and operated by a security guard to secure facility or office building. 
Badges contain technology like:
  - RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)
  - NFC (Near-field Communication)
  - Magnetic strip
  The guard at the access control vestibules provides: 
   - Visual deterrent
   - Assistance
   - Check Identity
   - Response
   
### Door Locks
these are the critical security control measure designed to restrict and regulate access to a specific spaces or properties, preventing unauthorised intrusions and safeguard the sensitive data and individuals.

Types of door Locks
  - Traditional Padlocks : These are easily defeated and  offer minimum protection
  
  - Basic Door looks :  These vulnerable to simple techniques like lock picking.
  
  - Modern Electronic Door Locks : These utilize various authentication methods for enhanced security. Authentication Method are:
	- Identification Numbers
	- Wireless Signals
	- Biometrics
  - Cipher Locks
