# Asset and Change Management


### Acquisition and Procurement

Acquisition: It is the process of obtaining goods and services.

Procurement: The entire process of sourcing and obtaining those good and services, including all the process that lead up to the acquisition.

#### Conducting the acquisition and procurement process.

Understand the different types of purchase options;

 - Company Credit Card: These are the quick purchase of low-cost items. The transaction limit and item restriction in palced on this card.

 - Individual purchase: These are the employee purchase, reimnersement request. These are used in emergencies or when no company credit card is available. 
 
 - Purchase order: These are the formal document issue by the purchase department. These are for larger and more expensive purchase. They are dictates the payment terms like NET 15, NET 30, NET 60.
 
 
Internal Approval Process:  It insure the purchase alignment with company goals. It validate budget allocation. It helps in assessing security and compatibility with existing infrastructure.

Post-Approval Procurement

These include product compatibility assessment, security check, configuration check, user training and integration into the existing workflow.

### Mobile Asset Deployments

There are three main Mobile deployment Model:
 
 BYOD(Bring Your Own Device): In this model employees use personal devices for work. It is cost-effective for employers. It's drawbacks includes reduced control over security and device management. 
 
 COPE(Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled): In this model company provides devices for employees. It provides more control oevr security and standards. It does include higher initial investment. In this model the employees who may have privacy concern they need to carry two devices. 
 
 CYOD(Choose Your Own Device): In this model employees select devices from a company approved list. It creates a  balance between employees choice and organizational control. The drawback includes initial cost of investment and privacy concerns.
 
 
#### Selecting the right Model
 
 The selection of right model takes in consideration of different things like specific needs, budget constraints and risk appetite of your organization.
 The analysis of cost, security and employee satisfaction of different model are:
  - BYOD may have hidden cost for security and compatibility.
  - COPE offer more control over devices and supports MDM.
  - CYOD provides a balance between flexibility and control.
  
### Asset Management 

 Asset management
 It's a systematic approach to governing and maximizing the value of items, an entity is responsible for throughout the asset's life cycle
  Tangible assets :
    - Office buildings
    - Computers
    - Machinery
    
   Intangible Assets: 
    - Intellectual Property 
    - Organization's reputation 
    - Goodwill
    
 Assignment and Accounting of Assets
  Each asset is assigned to a person or a group they are known as owner of that asset, the process of allocating the ownership is called Assignment. The process of accounting help in avoiding ambiguity, aids in troubleshooting, helps in better upgrades and replacement.
  
 Classification and categorization
 The assets should be classified and categorized. Classification should be based on criteria such as function and value. High-value assets may require stringent maintenance schedules. Low-value assets may be considered for recycle or disposal. 
 
 Monitoring and tracking of Assets
  Monitoring and tracking of assets ensures proper accounting and optimal use of assets.
  
   Asset Monitoring: It involves Maintaining an inventory with specifications, location, and assigned users.
   
   Asset Tracking: Asset tracking Goes beyond monitoring, involving the location, status, and condition of assets using specialized software and tracking technologies.
   
   Enumeration: This identifies and counts assets, especially in large organizations or during times of asset procurement or retirement. It aids in maintaining an accurate inventory.
   
  Mobile Device Management (MDM)
   MDM Manages and tracks mobile devices like:
    - Smartphones
    - Tablets
    - Laptops
    - Wearables
  
  It is a centralizer management system which enforces corporate policies, it ensures software uniformity and safeguard sensitive data. It enables remote lock and wipe of lost data, remote software updates and consistent user experiences. It reduces risk associated with unsecured or outdated devices. 
  
 ### Asset Disposal and Decommissioning
 
 Asset Disposal and decommissioning : This is a necessary to manage and dispose of outdated assets.
 
 NIST Special Publication 800-88 (Guidelines for Media Sanitization) provides guidance on asset disposal and decommissioning.
 
 Sanitization
  It is a thorough process to make data isaccesible and irrelevent from storage medium using traditional forensics method. It is applied to various storage media. 
  
  These method includes:
   - Overwriting: It is the process of replacing the existing data on a storage device with random bits of information to ensure that the original data is obscured. It is repeater serveral time to reduce any change of the original data being recovered. Overwritting can be used a single pass, 7 passes or 35 passes. 
   
   - Degaussing: It utilizes a machine called a degausser to produce a strong magnetic field that can disrupt magnetic domains on storage devices like hard drives or tapes. This renders data on the storage medium unreadable and irretrievable. After degaussing, a device can no longer be used to store data
   
   - Secure Erase: The secure Erase deletes data and ensures it can't be recovered. It is implemented in firmware level of storage devices. The built-in erasure routine purges all data blocks. It is Deprecated in favor of cryptographic erase.
   
   - Crytographic Erase(CE): This utilizes encryption technologies for data sanitization. It destroys or deletes encryption keys, rendering data unreadable. It is quick and efficient method of sanitization. This supports device repurposing without data leakage.
   
 Destruction
  This goes beyond sanitization, it ensures physical device is unusable.
  Recommended methods are:
   Shredding
   Pulverizing
   Melting
   Incinerating
  These methods are used for high-security environments, epically with secret or Top Secret data.
  
 Certification
  This acts as proof that data or hardware has been securely disposed of. It is very important for organizations with regulatory requirements. This creates a audit log of snitization, disposal or destruction.
  
 Data Retention.
  It is process of Strategically deciding what to keep and for how long. Every data has a lifecycle from creation to disposal. Retaining everything is not feasible due to cost and security risks. Clutter and excessive data require additional security measures.
  The reasons to retain data are:
   - Regulatory Requirements
   - Historical Analysis
   - Trend Prediction
   - Dispute Resolution.
    
 Data  Protection
 All data needs protection from potential data breaches. The more data is the more it  requires extensive security measures. This leads to higher cost and resource allocation. The always excessive data complicates retrieval and analysis.
 

### Change Management

 Change Management
 It is a Orchestrated strategy to transition teams, departments, and organizations from
existing state to a more desirable future state. It is necessary in modern business environments due to constant changes. Change is essential but requires Precision, planning and structures approach. It ensures changes are properly controlled, planned, and integrated to avoid disruptions.

 Challenges of change are
  Unplanned or poorly coordinated changes can lead to resistance and confusion
  Even seemingly simple changes, like software upgrades, can cause issues
  Existing processes become disrupted by changes, impacting efficiency
 
 Change Approval and Assessment
  All the changes done must be approved and assessed, it includes organizational processes and procedures. These change assessment evaluates value and potential disruptions. 
  Change Advisory Board (CAB): It is a body of representative from various parts of an organization that is responsible for evaluation of any proposed changes. It evaluates proposed changes before approval, assesses viability, impacts, and alignment with objectives. 
  
 
Change Owner
Individual or team responsible for initiating change request. They advocates for the change, details reasons, benefits, and challenges. They are key representative in presenting the case for the change.
 
 
Stakeholders
 These are individuals or teams with a vested interest in the proposed change. They directly impacted or involved in assessment and implementation. It includes technical, business, and end-uder stakeholders.
  
  These individual or teams must be :
  Consulted
  Their feedback considered
  Their concerns addressed
  
 
 Impact Analysis
  This is an integral part of the Change Management process. These are essential before implementing proposed changes. They assesses potential fallout, immediate effects, long-term impacts. It identifies challenges and prepares for maximizing benefits.
  

### Change Management Processes
 There are five Main Steps in Change Management
   
 Preparing for the change: It is done by understanding the current state and need for transition, by assessing existing processes and identify inefficiencies and challenges. Then gather necessary resources, engage stakeholders, and ensure readiness.
   
Creating a Vision for the change: It is done by crafting a clear and compelling vision for change. Also Inspire enthusiasm and buy-in across stakeholders can create the vision . It is also helped by defining the following things: 
    - Desired future state
    - Reasons for the change
    - Success for the change


   Implementing the change
   It is done by putting the plan into action, which may involve
    - Training
    - Restructuring,
    - Introducing new tools
   By maintain continuous communication with stakeholders and Addressing concerns and be open to feedback to reduce resistance can help in implementing the change.
   
   
   Verifying the change
    It is the measure of the effectiveness and ensure desired outcomes are achieved. 
    It might require the following thing to verify the change.
     Surveys
     Metrics analysis
     Stakeholder interviews
     
     
   Documenting the change
    It includes maintaining historical records of implemented changes. It also includes capturing lessons learned for future reference. Reflecting on past initiatives, improves the change management practices.
    
 Key aspect of the change management process
  
Scheduled Maintenance window
It is designated timeframes for implementing changes. It reduces potential disruptions to daily operations. It allows flexibility for emergency changes.
   
Backout Plan
These are pre-determined strategy to revert systems to their original state in case of
issues during change implementation. It acts as a safety net for ensuring quick return to normal operations.

Testing the result
It validates the success of the change by conducting tests on systems and operational processes after implementation. It ensures desired outcomes and identifies areas needing further adjustments.
   
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP's)
These are detailed step-by-step instructions for specific tasks. It ensures consistency, efficiency, and reduces errors in change implementation within the organization.
  
  
### Technical Implications of Changes

 Technical Implications of Changes are 
  Allow and Deny Lists
   Allow List: It specifies entities permitted to access a resource
   
   Deny List: This lists entities prevented from accessing a resource
   
By reviewing the both lists when proposing changes to prevent unintended access
restrictions or grants. It is essential for maintaining system functionality and security.

Restricted Activities
These are certain tasks labelled as 'restricted' due to their impact on system health or security. These proposed changes are verified for any restricted activities. It done to prevent data breaches and operational disruptions by understanding restrictions.
  
Downtime
Any change, even minor, carries the risk of causing downtime. It is the estimate potential downtime and assess its negative effects against benefits. These Schedule changes during maintenance windows to minimize impacts on end user.
   
Service and Application Restarts
Some changes, like installing security patches, require service or application restarts. Restarting critical services can be disruptive, potentially causing data loss
or backlog. Always consider the implications of restarts, especially for key servers.


Legacy Applications
Older software or systems still in use due to functionality and user needs are called as legacy applications. Legacy applications are less flexible and more sensitive to changes. Even a minor updates can lead to malfunctions or crashes, so assess their
compatibility.

Dependencies
The interconnected systems create dependencies, where changes in one area affect others. Mapping dependencies is crucial before implementing changes. It prevents cascading effects, outages, or disruptions in various parts of your network.
     
  
### Documenting Changes

Documenting changes: Documenting changes provides a clear history of the what, when, and why for accountability and future reference. 

Version Control
It is the system that tracks and manages changes in documents, software, and other files. It also allows multiple users to collaborate and revert to previous versions when needed. It ensures changes do not create chaos and helps track project evolution. This system preserves past iterations and ensures continuity and stability.


Proper Documentation
It is all accompanying documentation should be updated when implementing a change. All the updates should reflect the implementation of the change, from minor configurations to major network overhauls. Proper documentation is critical for clarity and accountability.

Key element of proper documentation are :
- Updating diagrams to provide a visual representation of system architecture.
- Revising policies and procedures to address issues or improvements.
- Updating change requests and trouble tickets to reflect successful completion

Continuous Improvement
It is done after implementing a change, it evaluate the process and its success. It identify issues and revise policies and procedures to prevent recurrence. It emphasizes iterative process improvement to ensure smoother future changes. <font color="#ffff00">It involves learning form past mistake for better change management practices.</font>

Importance of records

- Change requests and trouble tickets help create a clear timeline of change actions

- Inform stakeholders and provide a record of change history for future reference.

- Records are essential for communication and accountability in change management.
