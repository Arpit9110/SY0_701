### Impersonation
There are four  main form of impersonation that attacker use:
- Impersonation :
	In this attacker assumes the identity of another person to gain unauthorised access to resources or steak sensitive data. In this the attacker needs to collect information so that they can more easily impersonate the potential the victim.
	Consequences:
		1. Unauthorised access 
		2. Disruption of services
		3. Complete system takeover 
	Mitigation of these types of attacks involves organization to provide regular security awareness, training to their employee on a regular basis so that the organization can stay vigilant against future attacks. 

- Brand Impersonation:
	In this attack an attacker tries to impersonate and pretend to represent a legitimate company or a brand. The attacker uses brand's logo, language, and information to create deceptive communications or website.

		1. Educate their user about these types of threats.
		2. Use secure emails gateways to filter out phishing emails.
		3. Regularly monitor their brand's online presence to detect any fraudulent activities as soon as they occur. 
- Typosquatting:
	It is also known as URL hijacking or cybersquatting. It is basically a from of cyber attack where an attacker will register a domain name that is similar to a popular website but will contain some kind of common typographical errors which will misguide many legitimate user. 
	To prevent this type of attack an organization can do following things:
	1. Register common misspelling of their own domain names.
	2. Use services that monitor for similar domain registrations.

- Water Hole Attacks
	It is a targeted form of cyber security where attacker compromises a specific website or service that their target known to use. They  do this with the knowledge that the target will most definitely will access this service. The term water hole is metaphor taken from hunting. Rather than tracking its prey over a long distance, the hunter instead determines where the prey is likely to go, most commonly to a body of water -- the watering hole -- and the hunter waits there. When the prey comes of its own will, often with its guard down, the hunter attacks. 
	To mitigate Watering hole attacks an organization can do following things:
	1. Keep their system and software updated.
	2. Use threat Intelligence service to stay informed about new threats.
	3. Employ advanced malware detection and prevention tools.
### Pretexting 

   In this type of attack the attacker gives sone pretext of data and the user or the victim more or the rest of the information. The mitigation of this type of attack involves training the employee not fall for the pretext and not to fill in the  gaps for people when they are calling.
